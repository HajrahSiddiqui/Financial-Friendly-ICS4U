# Financial-Friendly-ICS4U
This is a project me and my friend, Muskan, made. This is essentially a financial budgeting program that helps people to track their expenses and showcases a progress bar as well as a pie chart. 

How to set up: 
1. Import the three images linked to this repository for the visual aspect of this program
2. Once downloaded to your computer, get the file paths and in the code insert for each page under the functions the dedicated page (there is a note for this in the comments)
3. Once file paths are successful, run the code and have fun budgeting!

Extra notes:
- The progress bar won't run unless you put in all the values for the expenses
- The graph will only show up when you put in all the expenses (on page 2)
- There are lots of motivational comments throughout the program!!

Purpose:
To help people track their expenses and provide them motivation through the stress of money organizing!
